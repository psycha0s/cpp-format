# C++ Format

C++ Format is a clang-format based C++ code formatter. The code is derived from the [clang-format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format) extension. The primary goal is to fix the horrible vscode C++ code editing behavior. This extension is still experemental, please don't expect much from it.

## Usage:

- If you use `vscode-cpptools` extension, make sure you have `"C_Cpp.formatting": "Disabled"`
- Set `"editor.formatOnPaste": true` and `"editor.formatOnType": true`
- Set `"[cpp]": { "editor.defaultFormatter": "psycha0s.cpp-format" }`
- Enjoy
